[Brief Introduction]
I am an aspiring computer science undergraduate leveraging on cybersecurity practical training in simulated lab environments and technical research internship with bespoke software solutions provider. Particularly proficient in penetration testing, with final cybersecurity certification project in building full decoy honeypots.

Building my practical skillset in technical and GRC areas of cybersecurity, as well as in customized software design for data integrity in high density locations to enhance operational efficiency, tracking accuracy, and workflow automation for industrial clients. Also, an avid sparring enthusiast who enjoys the unpredictability and challenge of worthy adversaries in Taekwondo :D.

[Practical Projects]
+ new portal design hardware to be implemented in factory using NF and FF RFID technology which reduced the amount of tag collision error and discrepancy by XX% (TBC the actual figure)
+ in-depth technical investigation and academic research paper review of RFID components, IoT and custom technologies for managemant of linen service (sheet/towel laundering and QC at a large hotel chain in Malaysia), including robust traceability of potential contaminants for future pandemic readiness.
+ + RFID components were:
  + a) RFID Antenna technologies- Dipole, Monopole, Patch, Yagi, Loop, Fractal, Slot, Planar Inverted-F Antenna (PIFA)
  + b) RFID Chip Technologies - Passive, Active, Battery-assisted Passive (BAP) devices, Write-Once Read Many (WORM) vs Read-Write Capabilities, Suitability assessments for specific security requirements with different frequency bands (LF, HF, UHF), Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) antennas.
  + c) RFID Reader Types - analyzing interface and connectivity options of RS232, USB, I2C, RS422, RS485 for data transmission and seamless integration with Android and Windows applications.
  + d) Performance optimization research on RFID Antenna Placement and Collision Detection Algorithms (ALOHA - and tree-based Query, Binary Search, Collision, algorithms).
  + e) Comparative analysis of Near-Field vs Far-Field RFID Communication and the theoretical underpinnings of both mechanisms.
  + f) Holistic evaluation of component selection and permutations and combinations of relted components with each option.
+ Performed penetration testing and reporting for Edtech Solutions, a globally distributed company providing customized software solutions.

+ Wrote Bash script to automize data/information extraction given a clone server/directory
+ Penetration testing - Created information gathering tool for finding open ports and vulnerabilities and brute-forcing passwords
+ Live SOC Monitoring (Kibana, Elastisearch) - Monitored real-time security alerts as well as raw log files in txt form, performed triage and investigated incidents in a simulated SOC environment
+ SOC Analysis (Wireshark) - Investigated real-world security incidents in a simulated SOC environment, analysing logs, detecting threats and responding to cyber-attacks using SIEM and EDR tools.
+ CyberDefenders Blue Team Labs Participation: Engaged in realistic browser-based labs simulating real world cybersecurity scenarios, enhancing skills in threat detection, incident response, digital forensics and malware analysis.
+ Log (N) Pacific Cyber Range:
+ + Vulnerability Management: Reduced critical vulnerabilities by 100% using Tenable and PowerShell Automation
  + Security Operations: Detected and mitigated brute force, ransomware and data exfiltration threats via EDR
  + Threat Intelligence: Built Sentinel dashboards and KQL queries for security monitoring and incident response
 
+ Conducted a third party risk assessment on a supplier as part of Cyber Security GRC Mastery Training course. The assessment consisted of reviewing a third-party security assessment questionnaire, assessing and summarizing the key risk items identified.
+ Asset Management: Designed a process to capture assets and maintain a CMDB as part of Cyber Security GRC Mastery Training Course
+ Conducted an end-to-end cyber security maturity assessment using NIST CSF framework as part of Cyber Security GRC Master Training course
